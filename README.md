A rhizomatic, sustainable and scalable community around decentralization with a first node in Caracas, Venezuela.

Caracas is one the crypto capitals of the world. Its transaction numbers and trade volume influence the entire Western Hemisphere. Yet, complexity determines the health of a civilization, and the abundance of miners and traders is sadly faced with a lack of startups, innovators and developers. We aim to change this by fostering a community around ETH. The pillars of the community are: Education (general and technical), Research, Public Policy, Ecosystem Development and Sustainability. Itâ€™ll be built to grow as a rhizome.

Before going deeper, let's first look at some data!

On this lines, we won't focus on hard research to point out to the causes of this paradox (we don't have the capacity to do such research right now anyway) but will draw from personal experiences while focusing on solutions rather than on the problematic gap.

For example, rather than just pointing out that in the innovation map, two of the three companies mentioned are media outlets and the other an exchange, we can value that such media houses could amplify future innovations made in Venezuela. Just as well, we won't focus on describing the role of the Venezuelan government as a bad actor but rather the only good thing that has come from its medling into the space, the entire population of Venezuela (+30MM, less if you shave off population under a certain age, etc.) inside and outside the country have some degree of knowledge that digital currencies exists, maybe just the state issued faux-crypto Petro, but either way, in no other country the entire population has had such a degree of exposure to this technology directly or indirectly.
