A rhizomatic, sustainable and scalable community around decentralization in Caracas, Venezuela.

Caracas is one the crypto capitals of the world. Its transaction numbers and trade volume influence the entire Western Hemisphere. Yet, complexity determines the health of a civilization, and the abundance of miners and traders is sadly faced with a lack of startups, innovators and developers. We aim to change this by fostering a community around ETH. The pillars of the community are: Education (general and technical), Research, Public Policy, Ecosystem Development and Sustainability. Itâ€™ll be built to grow as a rhizome.

Let's look at some data.
